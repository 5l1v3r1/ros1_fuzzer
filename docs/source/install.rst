Installation
============

Install the ROS fuzzer by directly downloading from PyPi:

::

    pip install ros_fuzzer

Otherwise, the fuzzer can be directly installed by cloning the repository and calling:

::

    pip install .


For development purposes, it's recommended to install the symlinked version of the application.

::

    pip install -e .
