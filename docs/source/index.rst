This is the documentation for the ROS1 Fuzzer developed by Alias Robotics.
This fuzzer allows to test ROS applications against limit cases that could cause failures or pose a security risk.
Currently the fuzzer allows to test ROS messages of any type by dynamically setting up the fuzz cases for each of the
message elements.
